# COVID-19 Risk Estimation
This repository contains the work conducted by Sedevizo Kielienyu for community risk modelling of COVID-19 under the supervision of Dr. Burak Kantarci. Documentation for the Python codes are generated using Sphinx. Details regarding the input files and output files of the code are given below, along with the pre-requisites that is required for this project:

1. Pre-requisites:
  Programming Language: The baseline programming language is Python, which is used to create all the functions regarding the risk modelling. For plotting the graphs, MATLAB is       used. Python version for this project is 3.8.4 and MATLAB version is R2020a.
