....This file shows the features/columns in each tuple that defines the csv file(s)....

1. 	UserMovementListEvents_0_Users.csv:
	feature tuple = <UserID, Latitude, Longitude, Hour, Min, Sec>
	
	'UserID' is the ID of the user. 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' represents the geo-location of an instance of a 
	user. 'Hour', 'Min', 'Sec' indicates the time for the pushed sensed sensory data which contains the geo-location.
	
2. 	paris_Users_Foresight.csv:
	feature tuple = <UserID, Latitude, Longitude, Hour, Min, Sec>	
	
	'UserID' is the ID of the user. 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' represents the geo-location of an instance of a 
	user. 'Hour', 'Min', 'Sec' indicates the time for the pushed sensed sensory data which contains the geo-location.

3.	tsne_Users_Foresight.csv:
	feature tuple = <tsne_2d_one, tsne_2d_two>
	
	'tsne_2d_one' is one of the two dimensions as a result of dimensionality reduction. Likewise, 'tsne_2d_two'
	represents the other axis/dimension.
	
4. 	labels_ClusterNum_Foresight_ClusteringMethod.csv:
	feature tuple = <label>
	
	'label' defines the cluster label for an instance (geo-location) of a user i
	
5. 	contact_list_ClusterNum_Foresight_ClusteringMethod.csv:
	feature tuple = <contact_list>
	
	'contact_list' defines the contact list of an instance of user i in cluster cluster c

6. cluster_riskfactor_ClusterNum_Foresight_ClusteringMethod.csv:
	feature tuple = <risk_factor_cluster>
	
	'risk_factor_cluster' defines the risk factor of each M clusters. In other words, it defines the cluster 
	risk factor.
	
7. risk_factor_ClusterNum_Foresight_ClusteringMethod.csv:
	feature tuple = <UserID, label, risk_factor>
	
	'UserID' is the ID of a user. 'label' is the cluster label of an instance of a user having a particular ID.
	'risk_factor' is the risk factor of that instance of user.
	
8.	user_count_ClusterNum_Foresight_ClusteringMethod.csv:
	feature tuple = <user_count>
	
	'user_count' defines the number of users in each of the M clusters.
	
9.	max_risk_factor_ClusterNum_Foresight_ClusteringMethod.csv:	
	feature tuple = <label, max_risk_factor>
	
	'label' is the cluster label for an instance of user i. 'max_risk_factor' 
	defines the maximum risk factor from an instance of a user in a cluster c.  

10.	std_riskfactor_ClusterNum_Foresight_ClusteringMethod.csv: 
	feature tuple = <label, std_risk_factor>
	
	'std_risk_factor' is the standard deviation of all the risk factors in a particular cluster c.
	
11. merged_list_ins_cl_ClusterNum_Foresight_ClusteringMethod.csv: 
	feature tuple = <UserID, Latitude, Longitude, Hour, Min, Sec, label, contact_list>
	
	This is a merged csv file of the mobility pattern, labels, and contact list
	
12.	error_values.csv:
	feature tuple = <avg_dependability, no_of_communities, clustering_method, foresight>
	
	For a particular 'clustering_method', 'avg_dependability' defines the average dependability for 
	M communities ('no_of_communities'), at t% ahead 'foresight'.
	
13. min_error_value.csv:
	feature tuple = <avg_dependability, no_of_communities, clustering_method, foresight>
	
	The tuples has the same description as that of csv file number 12, but this file contains only the maximum
	average dependability from all the three clustering methods (k-means, HMM, EM).
	
14. max_dependability_Users.csv: 
	feature tupple = <community, risk_estimation, dependability, clustering_method, foresight>
	
	In a particular 'clustering_method', 'community' is the identified community whose 
	risk estimation error ('risk_estimation') is the lowest, hence, having the highest 'dependability' 
	at a particular 'foresight' value.
